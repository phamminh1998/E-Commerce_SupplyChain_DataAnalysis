# DATACO SUPPLY-CHAIN ANALYSIS



---

## üìå Overview of Project

With the rise of big data and advancements in data collection and storage, industries like retail, e-commerce, and supply chain management now have more opportunities to leverage data for analysis, optimization, and decision-making. However, to fully capitalize on these opportunities, businesses must invest in data analytics expertise, either by upskilling employees or hiring specialists.  

This project serves as a hands-on exercise in end-to-end data analysis, covering key stages such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), database structuring, exploratory analysis, and dashboard/report development. The analysis is conducted using widely used tools in the field, including SQL, Python, and Power BI.  

The dataset used for this project is the **DataCo SMART SUPPLY CHAIN FOR BIG DATA ANALYSIS**, provided by **Fabian Constante, Fernando Silva, and Ant√≥nio Pereira** from **Universidad Central del Ecuador** and **Instituto Polit√©cnico de Leiria, Centro de Investiga√ß√£o em Inform√°tica e Comunica√ß√µes**.

## üìä Data Overview and Limitations  

The dataset contains **180,519 entries** with **53 attributes**, primarily capturing information on **orders, products, categories, locations, customers, and shipping details**. Each attribute is described in detail in the raw CSV file **`DescriptionDataCoSupplyChain`**.  
While the dataset provides valuable insights, it has some limitations:  

- **Missing Cost Data**: The dataset does not include details on product or operational costs. Without this information, it is difficult to perform profitability analysis or assess the financial efficiency of the supply chain.  
- **Limited Customer Demographics**: Customer segmentation is primarily based on geographic data. The dataset lacks detailed demographic attributes (such as age, gender, or purchasing behavior), which could enhance targeted marketing and product recommendations.

## üöÄ Steps to run Project  

This project follows a structured end-to-end data analysis workflow:  

1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Imported raw data into MySQL, Cleaned missing values, trim whitespace, normalize geographical data, handled data inconsistencies using SQL. SQL script: [1_clean_data](source/1_clean_data.sql)
   - Create a similar Python script to import, clean and handle data inconsistency: [1_clean_data.py](1_clean_data.py)

2. **Data Modeling & Schema Design**  
   - Designed a star schema with normalized dimension tables to reduce redundancy, optimize querying and modeling in Power BI/Tableau
   ![Database Diagram](<reports/figures/DataCo Supply Chain simple DB Diagram.png>)

      + orders_fact: detail on each order about item quantity, sales and profit, delivery detail.
      + dim_customer: customer information
      + dim_product: Details about products
      + dim_location: Normalize order location
      + dim_date: Dates for various events (order, shipping)
      + dim_department: Store_category
      + dim_market: Market information
      + dim_category: Product category
Detail can of SQL/Python Script can be seen in [2_create_star_schema_server.sql](source/2_create_star_schema_server.sql) and [2_create_star_schema.py](source/2_create_star_schema.py)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - [Answer some adhoc questions by SQL](source/3_adhoc_Data_Analysis.sql)
   ![Preview of SQL adhoc](<reports/figures/adhoc with SQL.png>)
   - Identified key trends and patterns in orders, delivery performance, and customer behavior  with Python [Jupyter Notebook](notebooks/3_experiment_data_analysis.ipynb)
   - Visualized insights using Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn)

4. **Dashboard & Report Development**  
   - Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key metrics  
   - Designed reports focusing on delivery performance and order trends  

5. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Interpreted findings and suggested actionable business improvements  
   - Identified areas for potential optimization in supply chain operations

## üîç Key Insights and findings

### üöö Shipping & Delivery Efficiency  
- **Shipping Modes & Late Deliveries**:  
  - **Standard Shipping**: Most used (~108,000 orders), also have the lowest late-delivery rate at **38% with ~42,000 orders were late**.  
  - **First-Class Shipping**: While is the second most used shipping method with 35,000 orders, have the highest late-delivery rate at **95.32% with 28,000 orders delayed**.  
  - **Same-Day Shipping**: 10,000 orders, but only 5,000 delivered on time.  
- **Order Processing & Timeliness**:  
  - **Faster processing (same-day, next-day)** leads to **on-time delivery**.  
  - Longer processing times (3rd‚Äì6th day) significantly increase **late delivery rates**.  
  - Improving **order processing efficiency** can enhance delivery performance. 

### üì¶ Order Trends  
- Order volumes show **seasonal fluctuations**, with a sharp decline in **Q4 2017**, requiring further investigation. Monitoring and forecasting trends can help maintain a stable supply chain.  
- Customer segments exhibit **distinct ordering patterns**:  
  - **Consumers & Corporate**: High order volumes but declining over time.  
  - **Home Office**: Lower but more stable order volume.  
  - Product categories remain consistent across segments, suggesting opportunities for **targeted marketing & inventory management**.  
- **Discounts & Profitability**:  
  - Discounts drive sales but **closely match total profits**, affecting margins.  
  - Some categories show profits slightly exceeding discounts, indicating **effective cost control**.  
  - Optimizing discount strategies is crucial for maximizing profitability.  

### üí∞ Sales & Profitability  
- **Top-performing products**:  
  - *Field & Stream Sportsman 16 Gun Fire Safe* leads in both **sales & profit**, followed by *Perfect Fitness Rip Deck* and *Diamondback Women's Comfort Bike*.  
  - Product selection and marketing play a vital role in success.  
- **Customer Segments & Revenue**:  
  - The **Consumers** category dominates **sales & profit**, outperforming Corporate and Home Office segments.  
- **Discount Strategy**:  
  - A **flat 10% discount** was applied across all categories, uniformly influencing sales.  
  - Profit margins align closely with discounts, showing a **trade-off between revenue & profitability**.  
  - Optimizing discount levels based on **customer segmentation & long-term sustainability** is essential.  

### üåç Geographic Performance  
- **Top regions by sales & profitability**:  
  - **Caguas (Puerto Rico)** leads in sales, presenting growth opportunities.  
  - **Chicago & Los Angeles** are key markets requiring continued focus.  
- **Delivery Delays & Regional Factors**:  
  - Shipping delays are **consistent across locations**, suggesting **internal operational inefficiencies** rather than regional logistics issues.  
  - Addressing **internal processing delays** is key to improving delivery performance.
